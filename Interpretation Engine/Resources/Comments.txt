CLSI	2025	pae	WHONET_ORG_CODE		2B-1	ALL	ALL	GENERAL	1	Refer to Table 1B-1 for antimicrobial agents that should be considered for testing and reporting by microbiology laboratories.	2025-09-29	
CLSI	2025	pae	WHONET_ORG_CODE		2B-1	ALL	ALL	GENERAL	2	For disk diffusion, test a maximum of 12 disks on a 150-mm plate and no more than 6 disks on a 100-mm plate; disks should be placed no less than 24 mm apart, center to center (see CLSI M022). Each zone diameter should be clearly measurable; overlapping zones prevent accurate measurement. Measure the diameter of the zones of complete inhibition (as judged by the unaided eye), including the diameter of the disk (see CLSI M02QG3). Hold the Petri plate a few inches above a black background illuminated with reflected light. The zone margin should be considered the area showing no obvious, visible growth that can be detected with the unaided eye. Ignore faint growth of tiny colonies that can be detected only with a magnifying lens at the edge of the zone of inhibited growth.	2025-09-29	
CLSI	2025	pae	WHONET_ORG_CODE		2B-1	ALL	ALL	GENERAL	3	The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis can be reliably determined by disk diffusion or dilution methods but may need extended incubation for up to 24 hours before reporting as susceptible.	2025-09-29	
CLSI	2025	pae	WHONET_ORG_CODE		2B-1	ALL	ALL	GENERAL	4	P. aeruginosa may develop resistance during therapy with all antimicrobial agents. Therefore, isolates that are initially susceptible may become resistant within a few days after initiation of therapy. Testing of repeat isolates may be warranted.	2025-09-29	
CLSI	2025	pae	WHONET_ORG_CODE		2B-1	ALL	ALL	GENERAL	5	An intermediate (I) with a ^ in Tables 2 indicates agents that have the potential to concentrate in the urine. The I^ is for informational use only. The decision to report I^ is best made by each laboratory based on institution-specific guidelines and in consultation with appropriate medical personnel.	2025-09-29	
CLSI	2025	pae	WHONET_ORG_CODE		2B-1	ALL	ALL	GENERAL	6	Positive blood culture broth can be used as the inoculum for direct disk diffusion testing of select antimicrobial agents against P. aeruginosa (using methods described in Table 3F-1 and applying breakpoints in Table 3F-3). For antimicrobial agents not listed in Table 3F-3 for P. aeruginosa, CLSI has not yet evaluated this direct disk diffusion method.	2025-09-29	
CLSI	2025	pae	WHONET_ORG_CODE		2B-1	J01CR	ATC_CODE	GENERAL	7	Organisms that test susceptible to the β-lactam agent alone are also considered susceptible to the β-lactam combination agent. However, organisms that test susceptible to the β-lactam combination agent cannot be assumed to be susceptible to the β-lactam agent alone. Similarly, organisms that test intermediate or resistant to the β-lactam agent alone may be susceptible to the β-lactam combination agent.	2025-09-29	
CLSI	2025	pae	WHONET_ORG_CODE		2B-1	TZP	WHONET_ABX_CODE	GENERAL	8	Breakpoints for intermediate are only to provide a buffer zone to prevent small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation.	2025-09-29	
CLSI	2025	pae	WHONET_ORG_CODE		2B-1	FDC	WHONET_ABX_CODE	GENERAL	9	The accuracy and reproducibility of cefiderocol testing results by disk diffusion and broth microdilution are markedly affected by iron concentration and inoculum preparation and may vary by disk and media manufacturer. Depending on the type of variance observed, false-resistant or false-susceptible results may occur. Testing subsequent isolates is encouraged. Discussion with prescribers and antimicrobial stewardship members regarding the potential for inaccuracies is recommended.	2025-09-29	
CLSI	2025	pae	WHONET_ORG_CODE		2B-1	J01XB	ATC_CODE	GENERAL	10	WARNING: Clinical and PK/PD data demonstrate colistin and polymyxin B have limited clinical efficacy, even if an intermediate result is obtained. Alternative agents are strongly preferred. Colistin and polymyxin B should be used in combination with one or more active antimicrobial agents. Consultation with an infectious diseases specialist is recommended.	2025-09-29	
CLSI	2025	pae	WHONET_ORG_CODE		2B-1	COL	WHONET_ABX_CODE	GENERAL	11	Colistin (methanesulfonate) should be given with a loading dose and maximum renally adjusted doses (see international consensus guidelines)	2025-09-29	
CLSI	2025	pae	WHONET_ORG_CODE		2B-1	POL	WHONET_ABX_CODE	GENERAL	12	Polymyxin B should be given with a loading dose and maximum recommended doses (see international consensus guidelines).	2025-09-29	
CLSI	2025	pae	WHONET_ORG_CODE		2B-1	J01XB	ATC_CODE	GENERAL	13	When colistin or polymyxin B is given systemically, neither is likely to be effective for pneumonia.	2025-09-29	
CLSI	2025	pae	WHONET_ORG_CODE		2B-1	COL	WHONET_ABX_CODE	GENERAL	14	For colistin, broth microdilution, CBDE, and CAT MIC methods are acceptable. For polymyxin B, broth microdilution is the only approved method. Disk diffusion and gradient diffusion methods should not be performed (see Table 3E).	2025-09-29	
CLSI	2025	pae	WHONET_ORG_CODE		2B-1	J01G	ATC_CODE	GENERAL	15	Breakpoints for tobramycin and amikacin are based on population distributions of various species, PK/PD target attainment analyses with an end point of net bacterial stasis, and limited clinical data. Clinical outcomes data for aminoglycosides as monotherapy for systemic infections are limited and have resulted in worse treatment outcomes (for infections outside of the urinary tract) compared with other therapies. Combination therapy for most indications other than UTIs should be considered. Consultation with an infectious diseases specialist is recommended.	2025-09-29	
CLSI	2025	pae	WHONET_ORG_CODE		2B-1	TOB	WHONET_ABX_CODE	GENERAL	16	Tobramycin does not predict susceptibility to gentamicin.	2025-09-29
